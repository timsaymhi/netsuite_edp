# NetSuit EDP Update
Update to NetSuite Effective Date Pricing

This collection of scripts enhances the currently available Effective Date Pricing SuiteApp and mainly focues on adding functionality around independent customer pricing.

These scripts will allow you to CSV upload promotional pricing and trigger pricing updates. The major enhancement is the ability to upload and save customer
base pricing which will reactivate once the promo pricing has ended. Scripts also include the ability to update open sales order with new base/promo pricing.

Currently, the scripts are not documented and will require a little SuiteScript / Javascript knowledge to unravel them. I intend to document the scripts in the near future.
